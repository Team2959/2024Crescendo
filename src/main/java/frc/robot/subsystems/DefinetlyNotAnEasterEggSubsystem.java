//I lied, it is an EasterEgg Subsystem :(

//An apple a day keeps the doctor away
//An easteregg a day keeps the easter bunny unemployed

//The easter bunny is homeless, are you happy now?

//'Eat lots of candy' - Definetly not the Easter Bunny

//No EasterEggs Today

//btw eggs are disgusting anyways
//except if they are made of chocolate
