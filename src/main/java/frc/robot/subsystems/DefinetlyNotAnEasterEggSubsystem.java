//I lied, it is an EasterEgg Subsystem :(

//An apple a day keeps the doctor away
//An easteregg a day keeps the easter bunny unemployed

//The easter bunny is homeless, are you happy now?

//'Eat lots of candy' - Definetly not the Easter Bunny

//No EasterEggs Today

//btw eggs are disgusting anyways
//except if they are made of chocolate

//I like my eggs hard boiled, over easy, scrambled, devlied and with hollendaise sauce

//Seems like there's a new easter bunny in town...
//There also seem to be over twenty EasterEggs scattered around the programming room.
//Can the new Easter bunny find them?

//The EasterEggs have multiplied, there's over forty now...
//Who will stop this madness?

//Nom, nom, nom - those eggs are disappearing

//Good Competition, time for EasterEggs

//The Easter Eggs RETURN 
//PREPARE YOURSELVES

//private boolean happiness = false;
// private void m_youAreHappy (boolean happiness) {
//if (m_youAreHappy && m_youKnowIt){
//    m_clapYourHands = true;
//}};

//We know it's wrong, don't judge us, we may have serious mental issues.


//There will be some EasterEggs in the Autonomous Playbook, will you find them?

//Time for some more EasterEggs...

//wow no response, the easter bunny will cry itself to sleep tonight

// [When reading imagine a bunny with a fur coat and an old sword, there's a heavy wind coming from behind and snowflakes filling the ground with snow. The bunny sticks his sword to the ground, looks straight to your eyes, and says the following with a really low voice.]
//Easter is coming...
